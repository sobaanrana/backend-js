Model  - DB and DB logic
View - data on interface
Controller - business logic

model used to interact with the DB and controller manages the logic i.e.
categorizing prices of products on the basis of classes

you decide which bussines logic to hit on which route

request - approprate route - contrller is mapped there - logic run (model method runs and business logic as well )



Frontend/Client send request to express app, it then sends to route, every route is mapped to a controller,
controller has a logic whihc is executed, or it can use model as well to  interact with DB , or run any other logic
controller then creates a response and send it back to the frontend

View is handled by react and for now in this case consider response as view 

npm init -y
npm install express mongoose nodemon dotenv
